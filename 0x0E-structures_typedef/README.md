# 0. Poppy : Define a new type struct dog with the following elements:
* name, type = char *
* age, type = float
* owner, type = char *

# 1. A dog is the only thing on earth that loves you more than you love yourself
* Write a function that initialize a variable of type struct dog

# 2. A dog will teach you unconditional love. If you can have that in your life, things won't be too bad
* Write a function that prints a struct dog
* You are allowed to use the standard library
* If an element of d is NULL, print (nil) instead of this element. (if name is NULL, print Name: (nil))
* If d is NULL print nothing.

# 3. Outside of a dog, a book is a man's best friend. Inside of a dog it's too dark to read
* Define a new type dog_t as a new name for the type struct dog.
